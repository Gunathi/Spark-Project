# Azure Databricks Project

This repository contains notebooks and code for a project developed using **Azure Databricks**. The project leverages Databricks' capabilities for data processing, and analysis, focusing on **user engagement analysis, data analysis**.

## Project Description

This project is my first pyspark project. In this project I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns, changing the schema and removing null rows. And also I could be able to do following tasks

3. Category Wise distribution of the installed apps with visualizations
4. Top paid apps
5. Which genre apps sold at a high Price
6. Identify the top-performing apps in each category based on user reviews and ratings
7. User Engagement Analysis
